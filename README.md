## Project Title

Generative Models: Convolutional Autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders

### Task and Model

The task is to generate similar images(fake) according to given dataset(real images).  
The Convolutional AutoEncoder(CAE) and Variational AutoEncoder(VAE) are created here, to reconstruct images for the UT Zappos50K Dataset.


### Prerequisites

I uploaded the zipped dataset(625 Mb) to Google drive, and used Google Colab to load & unzip the data, the dataset can be found here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nYEgytPOkFyUjDQfBGzwCQbszf6OE143/view?usp=sharing. You can also upload the unzipped dataset directly to your Colab, just remember to change the data path in Step 1 --'DATASETS/UTZappos50K'.


### Introduction

The UT Zappos50K Dataset used here contains 4 types of images, i.e. Boots, Sandals, Shoes, Slippers.


### Data Visualization
